# Project Name
Galactic Havoc
Project for MSCH-C220
A basic space-shooter arcade game, created in Unity.
## Implementation
I started with the game we made during the class exercises. I changed the assets and added a background to give the game a more cartoony feel. I changed fonts throughout the game to change the feel of the menus. I added two new enemies. The blue UFO enemy shoots a larger bullet that moves slower. The green UFO enemy moves faster, which makes it harder to kill. The red UFO enemy is the normal enemy that we made in the exercises. The enemies are spawned using a script that I wrote that spawns a random enemy every 10 seconds. I also added 2 power-ups. One of them gives you extra health, and the other one doubles the player's speed for 7 seconds. A random power-up is spawned every 10 seconds.
